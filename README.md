# About
Here is a platformer and here is an egg, platformEGG!

This game is a small platformer where you play as a ninja frog, who needs to bring an egg to finish line. Avoiding a lot of traps without dying or breaking the egg.

Sounds easy? Not for the ninja frog, as if she carries the egg, she can't jump. Luckily, she can throw the egg.
